# ðŸŒ± Patrick Smart Irrigation Dashboard â€” v2

**New in v2**
- Plot-aware logic:
  - Plot 1 = Baseline (manual only)
  - Plot 2 = Sensor + Weather
  - Plot 3 = NDVI + Weather
  - Plot 4 = Sensor + NDVI + Weather
- Auto-prefill **yesterdayâ€™s ETo** and rain from `Weather_ETo`.
- Unified NDVI (OCNâ†’RGN) with per-stage coefficients; used automatically.
- Once-a-day decision with TAW/RAW/Trigger VWC and recommended liters.
